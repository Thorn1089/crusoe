GOAP inspired system:

 - A *Goal* represents a desired state of the world (or sub-state).
 - An *Action* produces one or more *Effects* on the world, and has one or more *Preconditions*
 
Some example goals might be:
 
 - The player is at location X,Y
 - A wall is built at location X,Y
 
Some example actions might be:
 
 - MoveTo(Coordinates)
   - Effect: Player @ Coordinates
 - TurnTo(Orientation)
   - Effect: Player facing direction
 - BuildWallAt(Coordinates) 
   - Effect: Wall @ Coordinates
   - Precondition: Player has pickaxe
   
Given a goal, we want to answer the question "What actions will produce an effect that satisfies this goal?"
This might require a sequence of multiple actions based on the preconditions associated.

e.g. `planner.plan(goal) -> List<Action>`
